What's Up?
==========

Up is a markup language for writing structured documents in plain text. For more information, check out [tryup.org!](https://tryup.org)

Up supports:

- Super easy tables
- Revealable content (e.g. spoilers)
- Description lists
- Overlapping inline writing conventions
- So much more!

This is the repository for [up-lang](https://www.npmjs.com/package/up-lang), a Node.js package for converting Up markup into HTML.
