Up is a lightweight markup language for writing in plain text.

I'm not accepting contributions at this time!



This is a [link -> https://stackoverflow.com].

This is *emphasized*.

This is **stressed**.

This is some `inline_code()`. 

This is ++inserted++.

This is ~~removed~~.

This is [<_<]an important spoiler[>_>].

This is a regular sentence. ((And this is an aside.))


Styles can overlap!

I **love ~~drinking** whole~~ milk.

I do *not [care* at -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrot] all.


Within an inline code snippet, other conventions do not apply. This `*is not emphasized*`.


A backslash "escapes" the following character, removing any special meaning:

This is not a [link \-> https://stackoverflow.com].

This text is not \*emphasized\*.


Link URLs can easily contain [matching brackets -> https://google.com/search?q=[hi]].

If you need to include a non-matching bracket, escape it using a backslash.



This is a paragraph.

One or two blank lines separate paragraphs.



Three or more blank lines indicate separation between sections of the document.

Alternatively, you can just use a line!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Consecutive lines represent... lines. Not a paragraph.

Roses are read
Violets are blue
Lyrics have lines
And addresses do too


This is a top-level heading
#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#=#

The first heading in a document is always a top-level heading.

Use any underline! Any combination of the following characters is okay: `# = - + ~ * ^ @ : _`

Spaces can be interspersed if you want.

All subsequent headings with underlines consisting of the same characters are considered top-level.


This is a second-level heading
==============================

The same principle applies for second-level headings.

You can use any underline, as long as it doesn't consist of the all same characters used in top-level heading's underline.
 

This is a third-level heading
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+

Every heading level follows that same principle:

You can use any underline, as long as it consists of a unique combination of characters.

When creating a third-level heading, this means the underline must not consist of all the same characters used in the top-level and second-level headings. 


This is a fourth-level heading
# = = = = = = = = = = = = = = #

If an underline includes spaces, it's considered distinct from a similar underline that does not use spaces.

Otherwise, underlines consisting of the same characters are considered the same, even if the characters are arranged in a different order.


~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~
This is a fifth-level heading
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

Any heading can have an optional overline.

Documents can contain an unlimited number of heading levels, but some output formats (e.g. HTML) support a limited number.

* This is a list item

* This is the second list item
  
  This is a heading
  --------------------------
  
  - List items can contain any convention
  - Including other lists
  
* The blank lines between list items are optional


Ordered lists can start and stop at any ordinal:

3. Nintendo 64
4. GameCube


And ordered list can even be reversed:

3. Game Boy Advance
2. Game Boy Color
1. Game Boy


Ordered lists don't need numerals:

# You can use number signs instead
# You can even mix numerals with number signs
# This allows you to specify a list's direction or starting ordinal without having to manually count each item
