Up is a set of conventions for writing plain text.



This is a [helpful link -> https://stackoverflow.com].

This text is *emphasized*.

This is text is **stressed**.



All three conventions can be nested within each other.

This is an *emphasized and **stressed [link -> https://ddg.gg]***.

This [link contains **stressed and *emphasized text*** -> https://ddg.gg].

Innermost conventions must be "closed" before outer ones.



Link text [can contain [any] brackets -> https://altavista.com].

Link URLs [can contain any brackets -> https://google.com/search?q=[hi]].



A backslash "escapes" the following character, removing any special meaning:

This is not a \[helpful link -> https://stackoverflow.com].

This text is not \*emphasized\*.

This text is not \*\*stressed\*\*.



P.S. I'm not accepting contributions at this time!
