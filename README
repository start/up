Up is a set of conventions for writing plain text. I'm not accepting contributions at this time!



This is a [link -> https://stackoverflow.com].

This is *emphasized*.

This is **stressed**.

This is some `inline_code()`. 

This is ++inserted++.

This is ~~removed~~.

This is [<_<]an important spoiler[>_>].

This is a regular sentence. ((And this is an aside.))


Link text [can contain [any] brackets -> https://altavista.com].

Link URLs [can contain any brackets -> https://google.com/search?q=[hi]].


Within an inline code snippet, other conventions do not apply.

This `*is not emphasized*`.


A backslash "escapes" the following character, removing any special meaning:

This is not a \[helpful link -> https://stackoverflow.com].

This text is not \*emphasized\*.

This text is not \*\*stressed\*\*.

This is not some \`inline_code\`.



This is a paragraph.

One or two blank lines separate paragraphs.



Three or more blank lines indicates separation between sections of the document.

Consecutive lines represent... lines. Not a pagragraph.

Roses are read
Violets are blue
Lyrics have lines
And addresses do too
