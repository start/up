Up is a set of conventions for writing documents in plain text. I'm not accepting contributions at this time!



This is a [link -> https://stackoverflow.com].

This is *emphasized*.

This is **stressed**.

This is some `inline_code()`. 

This is ++inserted++.

This is ~~removed~~.

This is [<_<]an important spoiler[>_>].

This is a regular sentence. ((And this is an aside.))


Within an inline code snippet, other conventions do not apply. This `*is not emphasized*`.


A backslash "escapes" the following character, removing any special meaning:

This is not a \[link -> https://stackoverflow.com].

This text is not \*emphasized\*.


Link URLs can easily contain [matching brackets -> https://google.com/search?q=[hi]].

If you need to include any non-matching brackets, escape them using a backslash.


This is a paragraph.

One or two blank lines separate paragraphs.



Three or more blank lines indicate separation between sections of the document.

Alternatively, you can just use a line!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Consecutive lines represent... lines. Not a paragraph.

Roses are read
Violets are blue
Lyrics have lines
And addresses do too



This is a top-level heading

Any heading can have an optional overline
