// `Table.Cell` is an abstract class extended by both`Table.Header.Cell` and
// `Table.Row.Cell`.
//
// `Table.Cell` gets exported with our library's module. Conceivably, it could be
// used for some sort of processing or analysis of the abstract syntax tree. However,
// Up library users should never need to instantiate objects of that class, so it would
// be misleading to export it as non-abstract.
//
// During parsing, however, we do need to create objects that can later be converted to
// eaither header cells or row cells. Hence this fun little class.

  // bit easier for us to tell when a row ends with a single unescaped semicolon.

  // As a rule, if the last cell in the table isn't blank, and if it spans just a single

      //    length, we must have already found at least one cell (and thus `lastCell` won't
      //    be null).
